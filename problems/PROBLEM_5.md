# Problem 5 - Parsing a Binary Archive File

In an effort to reduce the payload size being transmitted from the weather station, a change was made to send the data encoded in a binary format instead of ASCII.

Make the following changes to your API:

- Add a new field to the Archive resource called `version` that tracks the Archive File version. CSV files should be marked as version 1. Binary files should be marked as version 2. Refer to [Appendix C](#appendix-c---api-blueprint-weather-archives-complete) for the complete Weather Archives API blueprint.
- Write a new binary file parser. The binary Archive file contains the same fields as the CSV Archive file. The format of the binary file is explained in [Appendix D](#appendix-d---binary-weather-archive-file-format).
- Update the Weather Archive API to allow a user to POST binary Archive File content to the API. The binary Archive file will need to get parsed by a [celery](https://github.com/celery/celery) task that creates individual Weather Observation resource objects.

The binary file [data/weather_archive.bin](../data/weather_archive.bin) contains 100 Weather Observations that you can use to test your function with. The Weather Observations in this binary file should be identical to the Weather Observations parsed by the [CSV Archive File](../data/weather_archive.csv).

## cURL Example
The following curl statement can be used to test your API:
```shell
$ curl -i -H 'content-type:application/octet-stream' --data-binary @data/weather_archive.bin localhost:8000/archive/
```

# Weather Archives API
A simple API for viewing Weather Archive data.

## Archive [/archive/{id}]
An Archive object has the following attributes:

+ id - A unique integer id
+ created - An ISO8601 date when the Archive object was created.
+ archive_file - Relative path to the location of the Archive file.
+ status - Status of the Archive file. One of ["Pending", "Running", "Complete", "Failure"].
+ version - Version of the Archive file. Version 1 is CSV format. Version 2 is binary format.

+ Parameters
    + id: 1 (required, number) - An unique identifier of the message.

## Appendix D - Binary Weather Archive File Format

A Weather Archive file consists of a set of Weather Observation records. Data is recorded in the file in **Little-Endian** ordering (most significant byte last). Each Weather Observation record is 13 bytes long. The following table describes the format of a Weather Observation record:

|Field              |Offset|Byte|Units          |Description|
|-------------------|------|----|---------------|-----------|
|Date               |0     |2   |See Description|Observation Date: ((Year - 2000) * 512 + Month * 32 + Day). See [Date Field](#date-field) for more info.|
|Time               |2     |2   |See Description|Observation Time: (Hour * 64 + Minute). See [Time Field](#time-field) for more info.|
|Temperature        |4     |2   |Â°F / 10        |Average Outside Temperature over the archive period.|
|Rainfall           |6     |2   |Inch / 100     |Rainfall over the archive period.|
|Barometric Pressure|8     |2   |Hg / 1000      |Barometer reading at the end of the archive period.|
|Humidity           |10    |1   |%              |Outside Humidity at the end of the archive period.|
|Wind Speed         |11    |1   |Mph            |Average Wind Speed over the archive interval.|
|Wind Direction     |12    |1   |               |Prevailing or Dominant Wind Direction code. See [Wind Direction Codes](#wind-direction-codes) for more info.|

### Date Field
The Date field is a 2-byte value.
- The 7 most significant bits represent the number of years after 2000 (0 to 127)
- The next 4 most significant bits represent the month (1 to 12)
- The 5 least significant bits represent the day (1 to 31)

You can convert a date into the integer value stored in the date field with the following formula:
date_value = (Year - 2000) * 512 + Month * 32 + Day

### Time Field
The Time field is a 2-byte value.
- The 5 most significant bits are unused
- The next 5 most significant bits represent the hour (0 to 24)
- The 6 least significant bits represent the minute (0 to 59)

You can convert a timestamp into the integer value stored in the time field with the following formula:
time_value = Hour * 64 + Minute
